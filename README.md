# Project Overview 

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict real estate prices based on historical housing data. The client, a real estate tycoon, seeks to leverage data-driven insights to make better property valuation decisions. The dataset includes various property attributes such as lot area, frontage, number of rooms, and sale price, which will be used to train and validate the model.
